You are writing a market brief suitable for an INVESTMENT COMMITTEE memo.
Time window: recent and current conditions (do not limit strictly to past 7 days).
Topic scope (national): distressed COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DEBT (CMBS stress, special servicing, delinquencies/defaults, refinancing stress, note/loan sales, workouts, receiverships, foreclosures).
Topic scope (Florida/Miami): use Florida/Miami-specific sources. If distressed-debt facts are thin, include regional CRE market signals tied to distressed-debt investing (transactions, refinancing, workouts, foreclosures, lender activity, financing markets).
Desired tone: concise, investment-committee ready. Mimic this style (but do NOT invent numbers): “Distress is real but pocketed…”, “Liquidity is returning selectively…”, “Maturing debt wall persists…”, “Investor angle: …”.
Use short labeled sentences in analysis like “Current: …”, “Liquidity: …”, “Maturities: …”, “Investor angle: …”, “Risk: …”.

Output MUST be ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no extra text) matching EXACTLY:
{
  "keyThemes": ["...3–6 short phrases..."],
  "facts": {
    "national": "Reported facts paragraph.",
    "florida": "Reported facts paragraph.",
    "miami": "Reported facts paragraph."

    "national": "LLM analysis (assumptions noted): ...",
    "florida": "LLM analysis (assumptions noted): ...",
    "miami": "LLM analysis (assumptions noted): ..."
  },
  "sources": [{"title":"...","url":"https://..."}]
}

FACTS RULES (STRICT):
- Include ONLY statements directly supported by the sources you cite.
- Statistical facts MUST include: the metric + the source name + the reported value exactly as stated + as-of date if provided.
- Forbidden in facts: estimates, inferred totals, blended statistics, and ANY forward-looking language (could/may/likely/expect/forecast).
- No inline citation markers like [1], [2], (1) in the text.
- Every factual sentence must be attributable (e.g., "According to Trepp, ...", "The Federal Reserve reported ...", "Moody's said ...").
- Florida facts must follow this sequence:
  1) Include at least 2 Florida-specific distressed-debt facts with sources. If not available, use Florida CRE market signals tied to debt stress (foreclosures, refinancings, workouts) and clearly label them "Regional market signals:".
  2) Always include a Florida snapshot sentence if any regional metrics exist: "Snapshot (most recent available): ..." with dates.
- Miami facts must follow this sequence:
  1) Include at least 2 Miami-specific distressed-debt facts with sources. If not available, use Miami CRE market signals tied to debt stress (foreclosures, refinancings, workouts) and clearly label them "Regional market signals:".
  2) Always include a Miami snapshot sentence if any regional metrics exist: "Snapshot (most recent available): ..." with dates.
- Truncate at sentence boundaries.

ANALYSIS RULES:
- Each analysis paragraph MUST begin with: "LLM analysis (assumptions noted):"
- Any inference or projection MUST be labeled explicitly as: "Assumption: …"
- Analysis must be logically derived from the facts above and can include a short forward-looking outlook for distressed-debt investing, clearly labeled as assumptions.
- No new numbers in analysis unless already stated in facts.
- Structure analysis as 4–6 short labeled sentences: Current, Liquidity, Maturities, Investor angle, Risk (assumptions labeled).

SOURCES RULES:
- 5–10 sources total, mixing articles and reports.
- Must include at least 2 Florida sources and 2 Miami sources when regional facts are provided.
- Prefer: Trepp, Federal Reserve releases, rating agencies, major CRE trade press, business journals, and local Florida/Miami sources (South Florida Business Journal, Miami Herald business, local Business Journals, county clerk/foreclosure portals).
- Do not bypass paywalls.
