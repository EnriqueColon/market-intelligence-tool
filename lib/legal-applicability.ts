/**
 * Who a legal development actually applies to, computed rather than asserted.
 *
 * The Legal Landscape tab used to end each card at a generated `whyItMatters`
 * paragraph, which claims importance without demonstrating it. The model cannot be
 * asked to name the affected institutions — that is the fabrication failure this feed
 * has already been through once, and an invented bank name is far more dangerous than
 * an invented URL because there is nothing to click and check.
 *
 * So the division of labour here is the one the rest of this repo already trusts: the
 * model proposes a *test* (a size band, a concentration threshold), and we answer it
 * ourselves against FDIC call-report data. The model is being asked what the rule says
 * about its own scope, which is on the page it cited, rather than what is in our
 * portfolio, which it has no way to know.
 *
 * ## The unit trap
 *
 * There are two different "CRE concentration" figures in this codebase and they are not
 * interchangeable:
 *
 * - `ScreeningRow.creConcentration` is CRE loans over **total loans**, 0–100.
 * - `ScreeningRow.capitalRatios.creToTier1Tier2` is CRE over **Tier 1 + Tier 2 capital**,
 *   expressed as a multiple, so `3` is 300%.
 *
 * Supervisory thresholds — the 2006 interagency CRE guidance, and every rule that has
 * cited it since — are measured against the second. A rule saying "CRE above 300% of
 * capital" compared against `creConcentration` matches **nothing, ever**, because that
 * field cannot exceed 100. It fails silently and looks like a rule that happens not to
 * affect anyone. Hence `minCreToCapitalPct`, named for its units, resolved against
 * `creToTier1Tier2 * 100` and nothing else.
 */

import type { ScreeningRow } from "@/lib/analytics/screening"

/**
 * The scope test a rule states about itself.
 *
 * Every field is optional because most developments state no quantitative scope at all,
 * and inventing one would defeat the point. Three states are deliberately
 * distinguishable: constraints present (compute the set), `appliesToAllInstitutions`
 * (the set is everyone), and neither (unknown — the card says nothing).
