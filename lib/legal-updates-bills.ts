/**
 * Does a legislative item cite a bill that exists, and is it the bill it claims?
 *
 * `legal-updates-sources.ts` asks whether a URL loads. For the other two sections that is a real
 * question, because a regulator's site returns an honest 404 for a page it does not have. For
 * legislation it answers nothing, and had been answering nothing since the guard was written:
 *
 * - congress.gov sits behind Cloudflare and returns **403** to us. `checkSourceUrl` treats 403 as
 *   "the host refused us, not that the page is absent", which is right for a press release and
 *   means no congress.gov URL was ever checked. `senate-bill/999999`, `401st-congress` and the
 *   literal path `senate-bill/not-a-bill` all returned `ok`.
 * - flsenate.gov and govinfo.gov serve soft 404s with HTTP 200, so gibberish passed there too.
 *
 * What that let through, from one live run: four items citing `S. 1234`, `H.R. 5678`, `S. 2345`
 * and `S. 3456` with commercial-real-estate titles. Every number is a real bill and not one of
 * those titles is. S. 1234 is the SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act; H.R. 5678 is the No Pay for
 * Disarray Act. The model had picked plausible sequential numbers and written CRE titles onto them,
 * and the feed had no way to notice.
 *
 * So the question here is stronger than "does the page load". A bill has an identity independent
 * of any page: a chamber, a number and a congress. That can be looked up, and the answer compared
 * with what the item claims.
