  return `Today's date is ${isoDay(nowMs)}. Your training data ends well before today, so you do not know what is recent — only the web search tool does. Never answer from memory: every item must come from a search you ran just now.

Do not make one broad query. Search the sources directly, naming a month, and run several searches before answering — for example "OCC news releases ${thisMonth}", "FDIC press releases ${lastMonth}", "Florida OFR ${thisMonth}". If a search returns nothing recent, try the previous month before giving up.

Every item must be dated on or after ${cutoff}. Omit anything older rather than padding the list to length; four genuinely recent items are worth more than ten that are not.

Every item must bear on commercial real estate credit, commercial property, or distressed debt — note sales, workouts, foreclosures, receiverships, REO. Routine supervisory housekeeping is not in scope: skip CRA performance evaluations, prohibition orders against individuals where CRE lending is not the subject, consumer-only matters, and anything whose connection to commercial property you would have to strain to explain. If an item's "Why it matters" could be written about any bank, it does not belong here.

Do not invent anything. Every "url" must be a page you actually opened through web search and that returned the document itself — never a URL assembled from a pattern, never a homepage, search page or index. Every bill number, docket number, institution name and date must appear on that page; if you did not read it there, leave the item out.

Search thoroughly before concluding there is nothing: open each source's own newsroom or bill listing for this month and the two before it. Only once you have actually looked may you return a short list, and a short list of verified items is the goal — but it has to follow the search rather than replace it.`

/**
 * Asks the model what a rule says about its own scope, so the tab can compute the affected
 * institutions from FDIC data instead of printing a claim.
 *
 * Two things this must not become. It must not ask which institutions are affected — the model
 * has no view of our data and would invent names, which is the failure this feed has already
 * been through. And it must not be answered by inference: a threshold the rule does not state
 * produces a confident count of the wrong thing, which is worse than an empty field, so the
 * instruction to omit is emphatic and repeated.
 *
 * **Regulatory only, deliberately.** Applied to the other two sections it produced nothing
 * usable, for a reason that turned out to be conceptual rather than fixable by wording. A
 * foreclosure statute applies to properties and lienholders, not to a set of insured banks by
 * size; a consent order applies to the one institution named in it. Asked anyway, the model
 * reached for `appliesToAllInstitutions` on Florida bills, which resolved to "every institution
 * in the state" — a large number carrying no information. Enforcement's actionable join is the
 * named institution, which is a different mechanism.
 *
 * `minCreToCapitalPct` is named for its units deliberately. Supervisory thresholds are measured
 * against Tier 1 + Tier 2 capital, while the screening table's `creConcentration` is CRE over
 * total loans and cannot exceed 100 — resolving one against the other silently matches nothing.
 * See `lib/legal-applicability.ts`.

const APPLICABILITY_INSTRUCTION = `Federal rules almost always state who they cover, usually in a section headed "Applicability" or "Scope", or in the press release as "applies to institutions with total assets of ...". Read that language and record it as an "applicability" object. Do not infer it from the subject matter.

  - "minTotalAssetsUsd" / "maxTotalAssetsUsd": asset thresholds in dollars, so $10 billion is 10000000000 and $100 billion is 100000000000. Community-bank relief usually sets a ceiling; capital and resolution rules usually set a floor.
  - "minCreToCapitalPct": a commercial real estate concentration threshold as a percentage of total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2). The 2006 interagency guidance limb is 300. Do not put a percentage of total loans or of total assets here — those are different measures and the number would be meaningless.
  - "minConstructionToCapitalPct": the construction and land development limb, as a percentage of total capital. The 2006 guidance limb is 100.
  - "appliesToAllInstitutions": true only where the document says it covers all insured institutions regardless of size. Do not use this as a default for a rule whose scope you could not find.
  - "basis": the scope quoted or closely paraphrased from the document, so a reader can check it.

If you did not find scope language in the document, omit "applicability" entirely. An omitted field is correct and expected. Never estimate a threshold, never carry one over from a different rule, and never repeat the example numbers above unless that is genuinely what this document says.`

Each item must be a distinct development. Interagency rules are issued jointly by several agencies and are still one item — list every issuer in a single "source" rather than repeating the rule once per agency.

Prefer a proposal still open for comment, or a rule with an effective date ahead of it, over one long settled.

For each item include:
- The exact rule/guidance title
- Issuing agency (source)
- Publication or effective date, as the most recent action on the item — never the date of an earlier version
- Whether it is Federal or Florida jurisdiction
- A 2-3 sentence plain-English summary of what it changes
- A 1-2 sentence "Why it matters" specifically for a distressed CRE debt investor (note sales, workouts, foreclosures, REO)

  legislative: `You are a CRE legislative intelligence analyst. Find up to 5 Florida state bills or U.S. federal bills — fewer if that is all there is — with active legislative movement that affect commercial real estate, mortgage lending, foreclosure law, property rights, landlord/tenant regulations, property tax assessments, or CRE-related banking regulations.

Prioritize bills that have passed a committee, received a floor vote, or been signed into law. Skip bills with no movement.

This section is legislation only. Every item must be a numbered bill, cited to its own page on a legislature's site showing that number. A court decision, an agency rule, a monetary policy action or an already-enacted statute is not a bill, however recent — those belong in the other sections, so leave them out.

Florida's regular session runs roughly January to March, and most session laws take effect on 1 July, so a genuine Florida item is often dated to the signing or to that effective date rather than to this month. Outside session, report what the last session enacted and any interim committee activity; Congress moves year-round, so look there too.

For each item include:
- The official bill title and bill number
- Legislative body (e.g., Florida Senate, U.S. House)
- Most recent action date — the latest action on the bill, not its introduction date
- Whether it is Federal or Florida jurisdiction
- A 2-3 sentence plain-English summary of what the bill does
- A 1-2 sentence "Why it matters" for a distressed CRE debt investor
