/**
 * Does a legal development bear on how this firm operates?
 *
 * Two separate questions, because the answers fail in different ways.
 *
 * **Is it on topic?** Verification made the feed truthful without making it useful. "OCC Releases
 * CRA Performance Evaluations for 23 National Banks" is recent, real and primary-sourced, and tells
 * a note buyer nothing. So does a bill about data centres on federal land. All of that reached the
 * tab.
 *
 * **Is its subject the firm's world at all?** A prohibition order against a named individual is a
 * ruling about one person's employability. It is real, primary-sourced, on a regulator's site, and
 * changes nothing about buying notes or working out loans.
 *
 * Both gates read only what the source *says*, never the model's own case for the item — see
 * `describedBy` below, which is the fix for the defect that let the whole gate be talked past.
 */

/**
 * The model writes `whyItMatters` under instruction to explain the item's "relevance to distressed
 * CRE debt investing". Reading it here asked the model to certify its own item, and it always
 * obliged: "OCC Enforcement Action: Danny Seibel Prohibited from Banking Activities" reached the
 * tab on a `whyItMatters` reading "can affect how lenders manage their CRE loan portfolios", while
 * its title, summary and status mention nothing of the kind. The gate was not too loose so much as
 * self-defeating, and no amount of term tuning would have fixed it.
 *
 * `summary` is kept because the prompt asks it to describe what the document changes, which is
 * reporting rather than argument, and an enforcement action is often titled with nothing but an
 * institution's name.

/**
 * Commercial property, the credit secured on it, and what happens to either in distress.
 *
 * Residential and land-use policy came out deliberately. `housing`, `affordable housing`,
 * `eviction`, `landlord`, `tenant`, `property tax`, `zoning` and `land use` admitted HUD
 * homelessness grants and residential tenancy bills — real legislation that does not reach this
 * firm's operations. `multifamily` stays, being an asset class here rather than a housing policy.
 *
 * Every entry is anchored with `\b` or ends in a stem that cannot appear inside an unrelated word.
 * Bare substrings are how `lien` admitted "client", "clients", "resilience" and "salient", and
 * `tenant` admitted "lieutenant" — four false positives in fifteen sample headlines.
 *
 * The terms are split into two lists below, which together are this one. Nothing is scored: a term
 * either names this world or it does not, and the split records which of those two it is.
 */
/**
 * Split by how selective a term actually is, not by what it means.
 *
 * A core term names this firm's world wherever it appears: nothing writes "commercial mortgage"
 * about something else. An incidental term appears in a sentence about something else at least as
 * often as not — a Florida bill on court procedure mentions liens, an Office of Personnel
 * Management rule on staff reviews is titled "Performance Appraisal", and a statute reviser's bill
 * deletes provisions rendered inoperative by "noncurrent" repeal.
 *
 * Where a term sits decides how much it counts; see `isCreRelevant`.
