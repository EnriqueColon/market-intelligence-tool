/**
 * Measured market figures for the industry outlook memo.
 *
 * Key Signals is the memo's Executive Summary, and it used to be barred from
 * carrying any figure at all — the only way to stop the model inventing one.
 * That kept it accurate and left it saying nothing.
 *
 * This module supplies the alternative: a small set of figures the app measures
 * itself, from FRED's public CSV endpoint and FDIC call reports. A number that
 * arrives this way cannot be fabricated — no model sees it before it is
 * formatted — so it is safe to print in the summary, and it gives the model
 * ground truth to write against instead of half-remembered statistics.
 *
 * Everything here is parsing and formatting only: no network calls, no Next.js
 * imports. Fetching lives in app/services/industry-outlook/verifiedMetrics.ts,
 * so this file stays unit testable with
 * `node --test --experimental-strip-types lib/verified-metrics.test.ts`.
